_SysIDE Editor_ is a free and open source SysML v2 textual editing and analysis tool, bringing rich SysML v2 language support to Visual Studio Code. _SysIDE Editor_ can also be integrated into other applications and automated workflows which need to interact with SysML v2 textual representations.

The main enabling components of _SysIDE Editor_ are a parser and a language server for SysML v2 and KerML [2024-11 release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/tree/2024-11) specifications.

_SysIDE Editor_ provides features such as:

- Semantic highlighting
- Autocompletion
- Code navigation
- Formatting
- Real-time syntax and semantic validation
- Reference search
- Folding
- Document symbols
- Renaming
- Documentation on hover

_SysIDE Editor_ is built and maintained by [**Sensmetry**](https://sensmetry.com/), a company focused on ensuring the safety and reliability of mission- & safety-critical automated systems.

## Quick start

### In a browser (without local VSCode)

You can try out _SysIDE Editor_ without needing to instal it locally. To do so:

1. Go to [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://vscode.dev)
2. Open the `Extensions` tab on the right of the screen
3. Search for and install _SysIDE Editor_
4. Open a folder or a `.sysml` file

This is a good way to get a taste for how _SysIDE Editor_ works. But if you plan on using it for a longer term or for larger models, we suggest installing it locally.

### Running locally

0. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com), or [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.com)
1. Open the `Extensions` tab on the right of the screen
2. Search for and install _SysIDE Editor_
3. Open a SysML v2 (.sysml) file and the extension will activate.
4. Link with the SysML v2 standard library:

## Standard library

_SysIDE Editor_ includes the standard library from the [SysML-v2-Release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/tree/2024-11/sysml.library) repository. The library is licenced under the LGPL v3.0, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release/tree/2024-11/LICENSE).

If you wish to use a different version of the standard library you can go to the _SysIDE Editor_ settings and enter the path to the directory with your preferred library.

## Developer instructions

### Building from source code

- [Install `pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `pnpm run grammar:generate` to generate TypeScript code from the grammar
  definition.
  <!-- Langium generator is broken until `addSuperPropertiesInternal`
  is fixed (not using the set parameter). -->
- Run `pnpm run build` to compile all TypeScript code.

### Make changes

- Run `pnpm run install-hooks` to install git hooks.
- Run `pnpm run watch` to have the TypeScript compiler run automatically after
  every change of the source files.
- Run `pnpm run grammar:watch` to have the Langium generator run automatically
  after every change of the grammar declaration.
- You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to
  the files listed above.
- You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your
  extension to load your changes.

### Packaging

To package the extension for VS Code run:
  
  ```bash
  pnpm run vscode:package
  ```
